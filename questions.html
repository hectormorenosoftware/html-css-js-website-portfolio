            Question: Why do I choose React JS over Vue JS, Angular 18, or
            Angular 19?
          </h3>
          <p>
            My answer: I chose React JS because Facebook created React JS and
            uses React JS in Facebook and Instagram. Which means that this
            library can be trusted at scale with large amounts of API requests
            and data. React JS can also be used to create apps in iOS and
            Android by using the React Native library.

            Question: Why do I choose Node JS over Java Sprint Boot or .Net?
          </h3>
          <p>
            My answer: Because Node JS uses the programming language C for
            API's, asynchronous requests, and data sorting through a library
            called libuv.
